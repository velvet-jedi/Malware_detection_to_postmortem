# Task 1 - Detection and response
## An alert has come into the Security Operation Centre (SOC). Triage the alert and respond to the malware attack by contacting the appropriate team.
 
 triage incoming threats and respond appropriately
 communicate the severity of the incident to the right person so 
 that the organization can come together in times of attack.


 The FW logs & list of infrastructure have been provided and show critical services 
 that run the Spring Framework and need to be online/uninterrupted. 
 A list of teams is present, which depending on the severity of the threat, must be contacted.

 The service is down and functionality is impaired due to the malware attack.
 triage the current malware threat and figure out which infrastructure is affected

 First, find out the key  infrastructure  currently under attack. 
 Note the priority of the affected infrastructure to the company - 
 Determine who is the respective team to notify.

 Draft an email to the respective team alerting them to begin an incident response. 
 And be prepared for mitigation advice.

# Task 2 - Log analysis/attack analysis
## Analyse the data of the malware attack to identify how the malware spreads. Find patterns used by the attacker so that we can prepare a firewall rule to stop the spread of the virus.
 After notifying the infrastructure owner of the current attack, 
 analyze the firewall logs to find the pattern in the attacker’s network requests. 
 You won’t be able to simply block IP addresses, because of the distributed nature of # the attack, but maybe there is another characteristic of the request that is easy to block.
 Ability to work across disciplines with multiple teams, both technical and non-technical.
 Understanding how the attacker scripted this attack.

 First, analyze the firewall logs in the resources section.
 Identify what characteristics of the Spring4Shell vulnerability have been used.
 Finally, draft an email to the networks team with your findings on firewall rules to mitigate the attack. Assuming that the recipient is technical and has dealt with these types of requests before.

# Task 3 - Mitigation (Scripting a firewall rule to block the patterned requests)
## Using the patterns you’ve identified, use Python to write a firewall rule to technically mitigate the malware from spreading.
 implement a firewall rule using Python 
 In this task, we will simulate the firewall’s scripting language by using an HTTP Server. which has no computational requirements and has the sole purpose of filtering incoming traffic.
 Use the test script to simulate the malicious requests to the server.

# Task 4 - Report writing / Postmortem
## Now that the incident has been resolved, create a postmortem to reflect on the details of the incident.
 The firewall rule worked in stopping the malware attack
 After an incident has occurred, it’s best practice to document and record what has happened. 
 A common report written after an incident is a postmortem, which covers a timeline of what has occurred, who was involved in responding to the incident, a root cause analysis, and any actions that have taken place.

 The purpose of the postmortem is to provide a ‘paper trail’ of what happened, 
 which may be used in future governance, risk, or compliance audits, but also to educate the team on what went down, especially for those on the team who weren’t involved.
 the more detail the better.
